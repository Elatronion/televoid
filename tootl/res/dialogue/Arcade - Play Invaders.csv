MESSAGE,"This game is called 'Invaders'.
I wonder if it's anything like the 1978 shoot 'em up
arcade game developed by Tomohiro Nishikado:
Space Invaders."
MESSAGE,"Manufactured and sold by Taito in Japan,
and licensed by the Midway division of Bally for
overseas distribution, Space Invaders, within the
shooter game genre, was the first fixed shooter and
set the template for the shoot 'em up genre."
MESSAGE,"The goal is to defeat wave after wave of descending
aliens with a horizontally moving laser to earn as
many points as possible."

MESSAGE,"But, following with tradition, like all the other
games in this arcade, this isn't anything like
Space Invaders... I feel like I'm in some kind of...
'bootleg' arcade."
RIGHT,ARCADE_DUDE_IDLE
MESSAGE,"Actually, I was thinking of renaming this arcade to
something along those lines!"
