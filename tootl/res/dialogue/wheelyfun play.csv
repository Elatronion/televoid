MESSAGE,"You know, arcades have included spinning wheels 
of all kinds for the longest time,
but they are far from what popularize them...
Wheel of Fortune, a game show that first ran on TV 
in 1952, is one of America's most popular game shows."
MESSAGE,"At it's peaks having over 40 million people watching 
five night per week!
I'm not exactly sure when humans started
putting numbers on wheels. But it does seem like 
we've always enjoyed our games of chance."
