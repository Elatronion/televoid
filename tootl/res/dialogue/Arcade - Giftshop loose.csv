MESSAGE,"No, wait. That's not how arcades work.
You're telling me that these machines won't spit out 
a varying amount of tickets based on my achievements 
in the game, but instead only reward me once 
for beating the game outright?"

MESSAGE,"And that I MUST win at every single game in your
arcade just to get ONE gift!?"
RIGHT,ARCADE_DUDE_IDLE
MESSAGE,"...
We don't have many gifts...
Plus, the games are free to play!"
